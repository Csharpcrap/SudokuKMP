# Sudoku

My first Sudoku application. Written in Java 8, developed and compiled using Netbeans. Created as a project to pass _Object Oriented Programming_ subject at my university.

Unfortunately at this part of my career I was writing my code in polish so it may be hard to understand it.

## Test boards

All boards are saved (as arrays), not generated, and I needed to have _test boards_ (one to pass game and one to fail game): number `10` and `11`.
